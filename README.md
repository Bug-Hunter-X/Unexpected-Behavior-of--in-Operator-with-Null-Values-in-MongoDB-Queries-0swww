# Unexpected Behavior of $in Operator with Null Values in MongoDB Queries

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.  The `$in` operator behaves unexpectedly when dealing with `null` values; it might not match documents where the field is `null`.

## Bug Description:

The provided JavaScript code showcases a scenario where a query using the `$in` operator with an array that includes `null` values fails to return documents where the corresponding field is `null`.  This is because `null` is treated differently within the `$in` operator's evaluation logic compared to other values.

## Solution:

A robust solution involves handling `null` values explicitly. The provided solution demonstrates how to structure the query to accurately match documents where the field is either a specific value or `null`.
